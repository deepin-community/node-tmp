Description: Temporary file and directory creator for Node.js
 The main difference between node-temp and node-tmp is that node-tmp more
 aggressively checks for the existence of the newly created temporary file
 and creates the new file with O_EXCL instead of simple O_CREAT | O_RDRW,
 so it is safer.
 .
 The API is slightly different as well, Tmp does not yet provide
 synchronous calls and all the parameters are optional.
 .
 Tmp uses crypto for determining random file names, or, when using templates,
 a six letter random identifier. And just in case that you do not have that
 much entropy left on your system, Tmp will fall back to pseudo random numbers.
 .
 You can set whether you want to remove the temporary file on process exit or
 not, and the destination directory can also be set.
 .
 Node.js is an event-based server-side JavaScript engine.
